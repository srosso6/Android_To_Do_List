A week-long assignment in the last week of the 16-week programming course I attended at CodeClan. The aim was to consolidate and build upon what I had learned in the previous two weeks including:

- Statically typed programming (Java)
- Mobile application development (Android)

This was an individual project in which I chose to create an app which allows users to create a to-do list, using SQLite as the persistent data storage.
